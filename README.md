Breast cancer is a dangerous disease for women. If it does not identify in the early-stage then the result will be the death of the patient. It is a common cancer in women worldwide. Worldwide near about 12% of women affected by breast cancer and the number is still increasing.

The doctors do not identify each and every breast cancer patient. Thatâ€™s the reason Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist comes into the picture because they have knowledge of maths and computational power.
We have extracted features of breast cancer patient cells and normal person cells. As a Machine learning engineer / Data Scientist has to create an ML model to classify malignant and benign tumor. To complete this ML project we are using the supervised machine learning classifier algorithm.
